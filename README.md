# Travel Web App with ReactJs
This is a Travel Web Development Project. I have created it using React js, I have also added Tailwind CSS framework in this application, firebase for authentication, aos for animation . I have also integrated some tools like React Hook form for form validation, react-hot-toast for notification and popup and swiper slider.

I have created 4 pages(Home, About, SingleDataDetails, Login/Register page).   I have implemented a search bar where user can search their destination using address/location. If a user find his desirable destination, he can book this desired place after ensuring loggedIn. And the booking data is being stored in local storage .  Here I have used prompt. In Navbar, I have shown user name and logout functionality. I have also implemented a popup video modal when a user click the image in single destination details page. I have handled  errors for authentication. I have ensured secure storage and handling of authentication tokens.
